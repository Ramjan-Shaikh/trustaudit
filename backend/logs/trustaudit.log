It states that Iron Man 'has actually wielded the Infinity Gauntlet (with all six Infinity Stones)' and achieved 'omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent' status. This is inaccurate for mainstream comic continuity. While Iron Man has briefly interacted with individual Infinity Stones or a deactivated Gauntlet, he has never fully wielded the complete, activated Infinity Gauntlet to achieve omnipotence as depicted by characters like Thanos or the Hulk. This inaccuracy forms the core premise of the 'Who Wins' section, rendering its primary conclusion flawed. While the prompt asks for 'ever mentioned in comics,' the phrasing implies a definitive achievement rather than a brief interaction or hypothetical scenario. The other 'maxed out' examples for both characters (Godkiller Armor, God of Iron, Mobius Chair, Hellbat, Yellow Lantern Ring) are largely accurate, and the reasoning for the Godkiller vs. Mobius Chair scenario is sound.
